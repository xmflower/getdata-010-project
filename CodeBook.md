## Tidy data set
The tidy data set is draw from the Samsung data, which collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. For full description, look at the 'Raw data' part. <br><br>
The tidy data set is about the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. <br><br>
The description for the variables: <br>
* activity
  * the six activities each volunteer performed:
  * WALKING
  * WALKING_UPSTAIRS 
  * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  * SITTING
  * STANDING 
  * LAYING
* subject
  * the value of the subject represents a volunteer who carried out the experiment
  * the value is from 1 to 30, represents volunteer No.1 to No.30 
* Avg_tBodyAcc_Mean_X
  * sss
* Avg_tBodyAcc_Mean_Y
