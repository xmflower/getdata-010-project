## Tidy data set
The tidy data set is draw from the Samsung data, which collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. For full description, look at the 'Raw data' part. <br><br>

The tidy data set is about the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. <br><br>

The abbreviations of the vaiable names denote: <br>
* Avg_ : the average for each activity and each subject
* t_ : time domain signals
* f_ : frequency domain signals
* BodyAcc_ : body acceleration signals
* GravityAcc_ : gravity acceleration signals
* BodyAccJerk_ : Jerk signals obtained by the body linear acceleration derived in time
* BodyGyroJerk_ : Jerk signals obtained by the body angular velocity derived in time
* _X : X-axial signals
* _Y : Y-axial signals
* _Z : Z-axial signals
* _Mean : the Mean value
* _Standard : the Standard deviation
