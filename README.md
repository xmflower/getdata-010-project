## Introduction
* This is for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course project. <br>
* This project is to get and clean the Samsung smartphone data to create a tidy data set.

## Files in this repo
* run_analysis.R
  * This is the R script to get and clean raw data, and then create a tidy data set.
* CodeBook.md
  * This is the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work to clean up the data. <br>

## How to use the script
* Put the raw data (Samsung smartphone data) into your working directory. That is, under your working directory, there should be a directory "UCI HAR Dataset" with the raw data in it. 
* Run the run_analysis.R script.
* The script will create a new txt file named 'tidy_data.txt' in your working directory, which is the tidy data set.
* For more details about how the script cleans data, see the CodeBook.md
